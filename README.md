# Project Valenheim

## About

We are creating a new text-based RPG website with a Medieval Fantasy setting. This server is split into two main roles - developers and creators. Creators are tasked with drawing up concepts for site features. Developers are tasked with coding said features. There is also an illustrator role for those interested in working on site illustrations. Working together, we aim to create a site with a high quality user interface, that is easy to navigate, and filled with great content for the users to enjoy.

## Languages/Frameworks

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5.3

## Current Priorities

The current priority is to create a pattern library for the project - this will include style defaults for various elements and components. These styles will be used consistently throughout the project.
